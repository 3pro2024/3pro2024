# Shuwa-pura v0.5 MVP Evaluation Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Shuwa-pura v0.5 MVP, a Japanese sign language learning application. The application was tested using Playwright MCP Server, focusing on UI/UX, functionality, responsive design, and educational effectiveness.

Overall, the application has a solid foundation with a clean design and a functional learning mode. However, a critical issue with video playback in the quiz mode severely impacts the core functionality. Additionally, several UI/UX and accessibility issues need to be addressed to improve the user experience.

This report details the findings and provides recommendations for improvement to prepare the application for its Open Campus demonstration.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### 2.1. User Interface (UI) Assessment

-   **Visual Design:** The application has a clean and simple visual design, which is appropriate for an educational tool. The color scheme is pleasant and the typography is generally readable.
-   **Component Evaluation:**
    -   **Buttons:** Buttons are clearly labeled and have a consistent style.
    -   **Forms:** Search boxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns are used effectively in the learning and quiz mode selection screens.
    -   **Video Player:** The video player in the learning mode works correctly, but it fails to play videos in the quiz mode.
    -   **Modals:** The confirmation dialog for ending a quiz is a good example of a well-implemented modal component.

### 2.2. User Experience (UX) Evaluation

-   **Navigation Flow:** The navigation between the main sections (Home, Quiz, Learn, Explain) is intuitive. The "Back" buttons provide a clear way to return to the previous screen.
-   **Interaction Design:**
    -   **Hover States:** Some interactive elements have hover states, but this could be applied more consistently for better visual feedback.
    -   **Form Validation:** The "Start" button in the quiz mode selection is disabled until the user makes a selection, which is good practice.
    -   **Search Functionality:** The search and filter functions in the learning mode are responsive and work as expected.

### 2.3. Functional Testing

-   **Core Features:**
    -   **Learning Mode:** Fully functional. Users can browse, search, and filter words, and view word details with video playback.
    -   **Quiz Modes:** **Critical Issue.** The video playback in the quiz mode is broken, preventing users from taking quizzes. This affects all quiz types (reading, expression, dialect).
    -   **Achievement System:** Not evaluated due to the inability to complete quizzes.
    -   **Result Display:** Not evaluated due to the inability to complete quizzes.
-   **Data Persistence:** Not evaluated due to the inability to complete quizzes.

### 2.4. Responsive Design & Accessibility

-   **Device Compatibility:**
    -   **Mobile:** The application is generally responsive and usable on mobile devices. The layout adapts well to smaller screens. However, the quiz mode selection screen is a bit cramped on mobile.
    -   **Tablet & Desktop:** The application displays well on larger screens.
-   **Accessibility Standards:**
    -   **Keyboard Navigation:** Basic keyboard navigation is possible, but focus management could be improved.
    -   **In-page Navigation:** The in-page navigation on the explanation page is not working, which is an accessibility issue.

## 3. Critical Issues

1.  **Quiz Video Playback Failure:**
    -   **Severity:** Critical
    -   **Location:** Quiz screen
    -   **Steps to Reproduce:** Start any quiz.
    -   **Impact:** Prevents users from using the core quiz functionality of the application.

2.  **In-page Navigation Not Working:**
    -   **Severity:** High
    -   **Location:** Explanation page
    -   **Steps to Reproduce:** Click on any of the links in the left-hand menu.
    -   **Impact:** Prevents users from easily navigating the explanation page content.

## 4. Improvement Recommendations

1.  **Fix Quiz Video Playback:** This is the highest priority issue and must be fixed for the application to be usable.
2.  **Fix In-page Navigation:** Implement proper scrolling for the in-page links on the explanation page.
3.  **Improve Explanation Page Layout:** Re-design the explanation page to make the connection between the links and the content clearer. Consider a single-column layout with expandable sections.
4.  **Enhance Responsive Design:** Add more spacing to the quiz mode selection screen on mobile devices to improve usability.
5.  **Improve Visual Feedback:** Add hover and active states to all interactive elements to provide better feedback to the user.
6.  **Conduct Accessibility Audit:** Perform a more thorough accessibility audit to identify and fix other potential issues.

## 5. Technical Observations

-   The application is built with TypeScript and Vite, which are modern and efficient technologies.
-   The use of YouTube for video hosting is a good choice for scalability and reliability.
-   The issue with video playback in the quiz mode might be related to how the video player component is initialized or how the video URL is passed to it in the quiz context.

## 6. Accessibility Assessment

-   **Keyboard Navigation:** While basic navigation is possible, some elements are not easily accessible via the keyboard.
-   **Focus Management:** The focus is not always clearly visible, and it doesn't always move logically between elements.
-   **Color Contrast:** The color contrast ratios appear to be generally good, but a more detailed analysis is recommended.

## 7. Mobile/Responsive Evaluation

-   The application is mostly responsive, with a good mobile-first approach in the learning mode.
-   The main area for improvement is the quiz mode selection screen, which needs better spacing on mobile.
